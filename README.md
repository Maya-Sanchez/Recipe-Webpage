# Recipe-Webpage

//this website is suppose to essentially be a quick menu of saved dishes. Users are able to click the title to see a small popup of the full recipe. They are also able to sign up for email updates.

I wasn't sure about how to use DocumentFragment interface and the Browser Object Model elements were not working for me.
